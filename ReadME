***API Fetches we have***
fetchRecipes
  takes our searchQuery from the search bar and returns a set number of responses
  .get(`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/search?query=${searchQuery}&number=${resPP}&apiKey=${process.env.API_KEY}`)

fetchRecipe
  takes the id and returns one recipe
  fetch(`http://localhost:7890/api/v1/recipes/${id}`)
  
fetchSimilarRecipes
  takes an ID and returns similiar recipes
  .get(`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/${id}/similar?${process.env.API_KEY}`)


***API Fetches we need***
fetchRandomRecipes
  Looks for random recipes with good pictures
  I think we're going to have to look ourselfs for recipes with good pics, get those IDs. Then hard code a couple different recipes and randomize our result for the page.
