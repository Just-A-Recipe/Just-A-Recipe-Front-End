Just a Recipe

Developed by; Anastasia Morozova, Surelis Segarra, James Eserjose, Dorje Kirsten, and Cody Brown

This app was developed in a week long remote sprint. Utilizing the Spoonacular API, which contains over 360,000 recipes and over 2,600 ingredients, the user can skip all of the blogs and excess that come with so many of todays recipes and get only what they came for- the ingredients and directions. If the user has any major allergens. intolerance, or dietary preferences, they can filter their search results accordingly using the checkboxes. 
(We do not under any circumstance guarantee any of the allergen or intolerance data *Use at your own risk*). Pictures are provided for majority of the recipes. If the user creates an account (Firebase), they can save and access their favorite recipes.
